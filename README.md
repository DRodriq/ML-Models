## About ##

This repo hosts my implementations of various machine models. Current models include
* Logistic Regression with a single data set as taught in Andrew Ng's course


## Testing ##

Each model file contains a main() definition and can be run standalone. 

## Roadmap ##

* Add more activation functions
* Assertions that variables will match up before computation
* Unit tests
* Add functions to shuffle dataset around before each run
* Add save feature for model parameters, feature to load models from file
* Visualizations, Graphs
* Interested Models:
    * Feedforward Neural Network
    * RNN
    * CNN
    * NEAT, hyperNEAT, ES-HyperNEAT
    * Reservoir computing, NVAR
    * GANs
    * ...
