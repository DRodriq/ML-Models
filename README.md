## About ##

This repo hosts my implementations of various machine models. Current models include
* Linear Classifier trained with backpropogation as taught in Andrew Ng's Deep Learning course
* L-Layer Feed Forward Neural Network as taught in Andrew Ng's Deep Learning course

## Testing ##

Each model file contains a main() definition and can be run standalone. 

## Roadmap ##

* Gradient Checking
* Batch running of Neural Network with various parameter sets
* Add support for more activation functions
* Unit tests
* Dataset Features
    * Shuffle datasets around before each run, training and tests sets
    * Synthesize new data examples from existing - rotations, blur, crops
* Option to save model parameters, load models from file
* Visualizations, Graphs
* Front-End / Wrapper UI
* Interested Models:
    * RNN
    * CNN
    * NEAT, hyperNEAT, ES-HyperNEAT
    * Graph NN
    * Reservoir computing, NVAR
    * GANs
    * ...
